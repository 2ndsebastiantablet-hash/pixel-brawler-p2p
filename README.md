# pixel-brawler-p2p

A fast 2D pixel-art platform brawler prototype with a canvas game loop, procedural chunky stick-figure fighters, peer-to-peer WebRTC movement sync, and Cloudflare Worker + Durable Object signaling.

## What is included

- Vite + TypeScript front end.
- Plain canvas side-view game loop with crisp pixel rendering.
- Main menu flow for Play, player setup, hosting, joining, and Offline Test.
- Player name/color customization stored in localStorage.
- Procedural one-color chunky pixel brawler rendering with idle, run, jump, double jump, slide, low slide, air dive, duck, ground slam, and slam landing poses.
- Compact in-game HUD for private room codes, public server names, and Offline Test.
- Escape server menu with player list, leave/end server, and host kick/ban controls.
- WebRTC DataChannel state replication at a compact tick rate.
- Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects for room creation, public room listing, lobby WebSockets, room metadata, player lists, and WebRTC offer/answer/ICE relay.

The Worker handles signaling and room management only. Gameplay simulation remains peer-to-peer and client-owned for now. Future rollback, prediction, and deterministic input sync should replace the current simple state replication in `src/net/WebRTCClient.ts` and `src/game/Game.ts`.

## Controls

- `A` / `D`: Move.
- `Space`: Jump, then double jump.
- `Shift` on ground: Dash / slide.
- `Shift` in air: Air dive.
- `S` on ground: Duck.
- `S` + `Shift` on ground: Low slide.
- `S` in air: Ground slam.
- `N`: Toggle player names.
- `Escape`: Server info / leave menu.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- npm.
- A Cloudflare account for deployment.

On Windows PowerShell, if `npm` is blocked by execution policy, use `npm.cmd` for the same commands.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
```

## Run the game locally

Start the Vite front end:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL, usually `http://localhost:5173`. Press **Play**, choose a name/color, then use **Offline Test** for local movement.

## Run the signaling Worker locally

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run worker:dev
```

The Worker runs at `http://localhost:8787` by default. The front end uses that URL automatically unless `VITE_SIGNALING_URL` is set.

## Test multiplayer locally

1. Start the Worker with `npm run worker:dev`.
2. Start the front end with `npm run dev`.
3. Open two browser windows at the Vite URL.
4. In window one, press **Play**, set name/color, choose **Host**, then host a private or public server.
5. Private rooms show a room code at the top of the game screen. Public rooms show the server name at the top right.
6. In window two, press **Play**, set name/color, choose **Join**, then enter the private room code or refresh and join a public server.
7. Press `Escape` in game to view players, leave, or host-manage the server.

If the peers do not connect, check both browser consoles and the Worker terminal. The current WebRTC setup uses a public STUN server and may need TURN later for restrictive networks.

## Host Kick And Ban

Hosts can kick or ban non-host players from the Escape menu. Bans use the stable `clientId` stored in each browser. The host browser stores banned client IDs in localStorage and sends that list when creating future private or public servers; the Worker enforces the list it receives for that room. Clearing host localStorage or hosting from another browser/device removes that local ban list.

## Cloudflare Pages deployment

Create a Cloudflare Pages project connected to the GitHub repository.

Use these Pages settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Root directory: repository root

If the Worker is deployed separately, add a Pages environment variable:

```text
VITE_SIGNALING_URL=https://<your-worker-name>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Then redeploy Pages so the front end points at the deployed signaling Worker.

## Cloudflare Worker deployment

The Worker and Durable Object config live in `wrangler.toml`.

Run locally:

```bash
npm run worker:dev
```

Deploy:

```bash
npm run worker:deploy
```

Wrangler will create the Durable Object classes declared in the `v1` migration on first deploy. The npm scripts pass `-c wrangler.toml` explicitly so Wrangler does not pick up a parent directory config when this repo sits inside another workspace.

## Useful scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server
npm run build        # TypeScript check and production build
npm run preview      # Preview built dist
npm run check        # TypeScript check and Vitest unit tests
npm test             # Vitest unit tests only
npm run worker:dev   # Local Cloudflare Worker/Durable Object signaling server
npm run worker:deploy
```

## Current limitations

- No final attacks, hitboxes, combat rules, matchmaking, cosmetics, or polished art yet.
- Networking uses simple state replication, not rollback netcode.
- Public room entries are short-lived development records hydrated from live Durable Objects when listed.
- TURN is not configured, so some restrictive networks may fail peer connection.
